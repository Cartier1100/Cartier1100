Hi there!ðŸ‘‹
In this repository I'm goind to upload my different projects over time.
I'm not an expert in programming, not even a junior I would say so don't expect too much
if you're looking for a reliable and professional content.

If you want to take a look and contact with me to improve some code in my programms
I will be so happy to talk with you and to perfect all I can.

This repository is made
for fun and âœ¨ rookie âœ¨ projects
